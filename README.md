Comparative Analysis of Curve Finance Performance Across Multiple Networks

Introduction:

The objective of this report is to present a comprehensive analysis of Curve Finance's performance on the Fantom network, juxtaposed with its performance on various other networks. Leveraging the robust data from the Dune website, this report delves into the intricacies of Curve Finance's operations to discern patterns, trends, and comparative metrics across networks.

Curve Finance on Fantom:

Exploration into Curve Finance on the Fantom network revealed compelling statistics. The platform facilitated approximately 2 million swap transactions, engaging a community of 68,000 swappers and generating a substantial total swap volume of 8.5 billion USD. Detailed examination of temporal data revealed notable peaks and fluctuations. Peak activity instances, such as 74,000 swap transactions in the second week of May and a record 6,400 weekly swappers by the end of June, highlighted the platform's dynamic nature. Noteworthy was the fourth week of January, witnessing the highest weekly swap volume, exceeding a remarkable 766 million USD.
However, recent data signaled a decline in swap volume on Curve Finance, indicative of diminishing enthusiasm compared to prior periods. A closer inspection of user retention patterns indicated that a majority of users engaged with the platform for just a single day, hinting at infrequent utilization of Curve on the Fantom network.

Comparative Analysis Across Networks:

Expanding the analytical scope to compare Curve's performance across multiple networks yielded insightful disparities. Fantom emerged as the network hosting the highest number of swap transactions, presenting a stark contrast to Celo, which exhibited the lowest transaction count. Ethereum boasted the most extensive user base, while Celo attracted the fewest users to the Curve Finance ecosystem.
A significant highlight was Ethereum's dominance in swap volume metrics, significantly outperforming other networks. Surprisingly, Fantom secured the second position in terms of swap volume, surpassing even Optimism, showcasing its substantial transactional activity within Curve Finance.

Conclusion:

This comparative analysis underscores the dynamic nature of user engagement and transactional activity within the decentralized finance landscape. While Fantom displayed impressive transactional volumes, the data indicates a recent decline in activity, suggesting a potential shift in user behavior. Ethereum, with its substantial user base and dominant swap volumes, stands out as a robust network for Curve Finance. This report highlights the nuanced performance of Curve Finance across diverse networks, providing valuable insights for strategic decision-making within the decentralized finance space.
